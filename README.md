# Advanced Tic-Tac-Toe

This repository contains an implementation of an advanced Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game is built using React and Vite, providing a user-friendly and interactive interface for playing Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Live Demo

You can access the live demo by following this link: [Tic Tac Toe Demo â†—](https://tic-tac-toe-okvc.onrender.com)

## Features

- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent or another player in a 2-player game
- Choose between different difficulty levels for the AI
- Enjoy a visually appealing game interface
- Experience real-time updates with Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

## Game Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your marks (either X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. In this advanced version, you can play against an AI opponent that utilizes the minimax algorithm, making it a challenging and strategic game.

## Minimax Algorithm

The AI opponent in this game uses the minimax algorithm to make intelligent moves. The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in two-player games. It evaluates the possible moves and chooses the one that maximizes its own chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's chances. By incorporating the minimax algorithm, the AI opponent provides a challenging gameplay experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0mar-helal/Advanced-Tic-Tac-Toe.git

   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd Advanced-Tic-Tac-Toe
   npm install

   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev

   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to play the game.

## Acknowledgements

- The minimax algorithm implementation in this game is inspired by the work of countless researchers and contributors in the field of artificial intelligence and game theory.
